# Sport Pressure Sensor

The project aims to improve sports performance while using bats, poles, or any kind of sports instrument, act to analyze errors in real-time or processed on demand on an App. Through multiple sensors of position, acceleration, temperature, and a magnetometer, accuracy and precision with low error is achieved.

The following prototype can be reduced in size, with other less bulky processors, a Raspberry Pi 3 and a wiring adapter was used for convenience in setup.

This project developed a tactile pressure sensor, via a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Adafruit 9-DOF, which communicates pressure data to a smartphone via bluetooth.
