# Sport Pressure Sensor

The project aims to improve sports performance and analyze errors in real time or processed on demand, through multiple sensors of position, acceleration, temperature and through a magnetometer increases accuracy.

The following prototype can be reduced in size, with other less bulky processors, a Raspberry Pi 3 and a wiring adapter was used for convenience in setup.

This project developed a tactile pressure sensor, via a Raspberry Pi 3 and an Adafruit 9-DOF, which communicates pressure data to a smartphone via bluetooth.
